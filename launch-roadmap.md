# MC Training — Launch Roadmap (governing plan)

Status: **ACTIVE — L0 not started**
Approved: 2026-07-12 (executive summary approved by owner)
Goal: drive the app from its current state to a **finished, launch-ready
product** — an installable PWA with a commercial layer.

> **This is the governing development plan.** It supersedes (but links, and
> does not duplicate) the open threads in:
> - `council-roadmap-status.md` — Phases 0–3 shipped; Phase 3.5 deferred;
>   Phase 4 scoped-not-started (items promoted into L4 below).
> - `pm-improvement-roadmap.md` — owner-only PM-mode backlog (independent
>   track; not launch-gating unless noted).
> - `CLAUDE.md` § Active Development Plan (`workout_cookbook_dev_plan_v2`) —
>   complete except two closeout items, absorbed into L0 below.

## Locked decisions (owner, session 2026-07-12)

- **Launch definition:** installable mobile PWA **and** paid/commercial
  product. Not date-gated — launch happens when the Definition of Done (L6)
  is met, however long that takes.
- **First-class priority areas:** UI/UX & visual design · mobile experience ·
  onboarding & ease of use · new functionality. All four get a dedicated
  phase; none is best-effort.
- **Process:** phases execute in order L0 → L6. Each phase gets its own
  executive summary + explicit approval before any code is written
  (CLAUDE.md planning rule), and an AskUserQuestion phase gate before the
  next phase starts. This document is updated (status + shipped notes) as
  each phase lands.
- **Workflow invariants:** all work in `4-Weeks-to-Open-` (master); never
  push to `MC-Training-Rolodex` (generated build, auto-deployed on merge to
  main). Local gates before every PR: `node --check` all touched JS ·
  `tools/test-mc-suggest.js` · `tools/test-mc-maxout.js` ·
  `tools/test-naming.js` · `tools/check-program-colors.js` ·
  `tools/validate-programs.js` · `python3 tools/build-market.py --check` ·
  `python3 tools/build-sw.py --check` (bump SW version when assets change).

## Phase L0 — Debt closeout & audit baseline

**Goal:** enter the improvement phases with zero known loose ends and a
concrete, page-by-page findings list so L1–L3 fix *observed* problems, not
guessed ones.

Tasks:
1. **Close dev-plan-v2 Task 3.2** — re-verify `mc-replace.js` swap
   confirmation and whether `mc-live-tracker.js` reads from the
   `mc_daily_v1` store vs. the DOM; fix whichever is stale.
2. **Retire `exercisedata.json`** — confirm nothing still reads the legacy
   904-record dataset (superseded by `exercise-catalog.js`), then remove it
   from the tree, `content-manifest.json`, and the SW precache.
3. **`serviceWorker` truthiness sweep** — `mc-push.js:30` still uses the
   truthy-vs-`'serviceWorker' in navigator` pattern that bit
   `mc-sw-update.js`/`exercise-library.html`; sweep the whole repo.
4. **Full UX/design audit** — walk every user-facing page (dashboard tabs,
   every program landing + day page family, tools like max-out/stats/wrapped,
   quick tour) on a phone-sized viewport; log findings per page under the
   four priority areas. Deliverable: `launch-audit-findings.md` (feeds L1–L3
   task lists).
5. **Widen the regression net** — extend `tools/smoke-test-pages.js` beyond
   its current 18-page sample toward the full user-facing page list, so the
   later phases refactor against a real safety net.

Exit criteria: Task 3.2 verified closed · `exercisedata.json` gone from
master and Rolodex build · sweep clean · audit findings doc merged · smoke
test covers all page families.

## Phase L1 — UI/UX & design-system unification

**Goal:** the app reads as one designed product on every page — same tokens,
type, spacing, and states everywhere.

Tasks (to be finalized from the L0 audit):
1. **One token system** — reconcile `base.css` with the `onyx-*` token/style
   sheets; every page consumes shared tokens, no per-page drift.
2. **Finish the Sand light-mode rollout fleet-wide** — Phase 7 batches have
   covered MC, Kitchen Sink, Strength & Supersets, PMC, Modality Matrix;
   complete the remaining program families and shared surfaces so light mode
   is a first-class theme, not a partial one.
3. **Typography & spacing pass** — consistent scale, weights, and rhythm
   across dashboard, program pages, and tools.
4. **Empty/loading/error states** — every list, chart, and sheet has a
   designed empty state (no blank panels), consistent with the
   `showEmpty()` pattern already in `mc-macros.js`.
5. **Motion & transition polish** — consistent card/sheet/tab transitions;
   respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Exit criteria: token audit shows zero hardcoded one-off colors on shared
surfaces · Sand mode complete on all user-facing pages · audit-list UI items
for this phase closed.

## Phase L2 — Mobile experience & PWA installability

**Goal:** installs cleanly on iOS and Android, feels app-like, works
one-handed in a gym, and works offline where it matters.

Tasks:
1. **Real icon set** — `manifest.json` currently ships a single SVG
   (`icon.svg`), which iOS ignores: add PNG 192/512 + maskable variants,
   `apple-touch-icon`, and manifest `screenshots` for install sheets.
2. **Service-worker strategy tune-up** — `sw.js` (v125) precaches the entire
   tree, including the four `*.dc.html` design comps and non-user files;
   teach `tools/build-sw.py` an exclusion list, and define what must work
   offline (active program pages, logging, timers) vs. network-first
   (macros API, sync).
3. **Install-prompt UX** — in-app "Add to Home Screen" moment (Android
   `beforeinstallprompt`, iOS instruction sheet), surfaced from onboarding
   and settings, never nagging.
4. **iOS standalone quirks pass** — safe-area insets, status-bar/theme
   color, no 300ms-tap or rubber-band artifacts, `standalone` navigation
   (no dead ends without browser chrome).
5. **Gym-floor ergonomics** — touch-target minimums (44px), thumb-zone
   placement for the highest-frequency actions (log set, rest timer, next
   exercise), sweat-proof big-tap variants where the audit flags them.
6. **Performance budget** — Lighthouse PWA + performance baseline recorded
   now, budget enforced in L6.

Exit criteria: Lighthouse PWA installability checks pass · install verified
on a real iPhone and Android device · core workout flow fully usable offline
· audit-list mobile items closed.

## Phase L3 — Onboarding & ease of use

**Goal:** a brand-new trainee reaches their first logged set in minimal
taps, and every major feature is discoverable without being told.

Tasks:
1. **First-run experience** — detect first visit; short guided path:
   pick a program → see this week → start Day 1. No wall of choices.
2. **Quick-tour refresh** — bring `quick-tour.html` /
   `quick-tour-overview.html` current with everything shipped since they
   were written (documentation-currency rule says they must track features;
   verify they actually do), and make the tour reachable from onboarding.
3. **Taps-to-first-workout metric** — count today's path, set a target
   (≤3 taps from open to Day-1 exercise list), and redesign the home/
   dashboard entry flow to hit it.
4. **Feature discoverability** — the audit will flag buried features
   (substitute picker, conditioning corner, macros, max-out, wrapped);
   add contextual entry points instead of relying on the tour.
5. **Program guide clarity** — `program-guide.html` as the "which program is
   for me" front door, with plain-language descriptions per program.

Exit criteria: first-run flow ships · taps target met · tours verified
current against the live feature set · audit-list onboarding items closed.

## Phase L4 — Functionality completion

**Goal:** the feature set is *complete* for launch — nothing a paying user
would immediately ask "where is…?" about.

Tasks:
1. **Unify progress & history** — `mc-stats.js`, `mc-exercise-trends.js`,
   `mc-chart.js`, `wrapped.html`, `workout-logs.html` exist as separate
   surfaces; unify into one coherent Progress area (history, PRs, trends,
   volume) reachable from the dashboard.
2. **Promoted council Phase-4 items** (owner to confirm at phase gate;
   candidates in priority order):
   - **4.6 Automated weekly check-ins** — infra partially exists
     (`mc-push.js`, `supabase/functions/weekly-checkin`, `phase10-push.sql`);
     verify actual state, then finish.
   - **4.2 Natural-language food logging** — builds on the shared
     `mc-foodapi.js` modules.
   - **4.1 Structured coach-claude chips** — gates on first verifying the
     `coach-claude` edge function's real state (unverified since the
     original audit; see council doc).
3. **Audit-driven gaps** — whatever L0's findings list surfaces as missing
   table-stakes functionality.
4. **Explicitly NOT in scope:** council Phase 3.5 (the `mc-s*`/`pmc-s*`
   data-drive refactor) stays deferred — it's internal code health, not
   launch-gating; and PM-mode backlog items ride their own roadmap.

Exit criteria: Progress area shipped · promoted items shipped or explicitly
descoped by owner decision · no open "table-stakes" findings from L0.

## Phase L5 — Commercial layer

**Goal:** the app can take money and gate content, legally and safely, on a
static GitHub Pages host.

> ⚠️ **Architecture spike required first.** Payments on a static host means
> the trust boundary lives in Supabase (edge functions + RLS), not the
> pages. The spike must settle: payment provider (Stripe Checkout is the
> likely fit — redirect flow, no PCI surface, webhooks into an edge
> function), what exactly is gated (programs? PM features? the whole app?),
> and how entitlements map onto the existing Supabase auth
> (`mc-account.js`, `mc-supabase.js`, RLS patterns). No commitment until the
> spike's exec summary is approved.

Tasks:
1. **Entitlement model** — Supabase table + RLS: user → plan → gated
   content; client reads entitlements, server enforces them (client-side
   gating alone is cosmetic, and the code is public — the *data*, e.g.
   premium program content, must be what's protected).
2. **Payment integration** — provider checkout + webhook edge function
   writing entitlements; test-mode end-to-end before anything real.
3. **Gated-content UX** — locked-state cards, upgrade sheet, restore
   purchase / manage subscription path.
4. **Legal & trust pages** — privacy policy, terms of service, refund
   policy; linked from onboarding and the account sheet.
5. **Public landing page** — the marketing front door (`index.html` today
   goes straight to the app); what the product is, screenshots, install
   instructions, pricing.
6. **Rolodex interplay** — decide what the free public Rolodex build is
   post-launch (demo tier? separate free app?); `build-market.py` already
   provides the strip/leak-scan machinery.

Exit criteria: test-mode purchase → entitlement → gated content unlock works
end-to-end · legal pages live · landing page live · Rolodex positioning
decided and documented.

## Phase L6 — Launch hardening (Definition of Done)

**Goal:** the final gate. When every box below is checked, the product is
launched.

Tasks & checklist:
1. **Cross-device QA matrix** — iOS Safari (installed + browser), Android
   Chrome (installed + browser), small/large phones, tablet, desktop; every
   core flow (install → onboard → run a full workout → log → sync → check
   progress → purchase) passes on each.
2. **Performance budget enforced** — Lighthouse: Performance ≥ 90 on
   dashboard + a day page over mid-tier mobile throttling; PWA checks green.
3. **Accessibility pass** — keyboard/focus order, contrast (build on the
   Phase 0 a11y floor), screen-reader labels on the workout logging flow,
   `prefers-reduced-motion` honored.
4. **Regression net final** — smoke test covers all page families (from
   L0.5), all local gates green in CI, SW version bumped and update flow
   (`mc-sw-update.js`) verified on-device.
5. **Data safety** — export/import verified, Supabase backups confirmed,
   sync-conflict behavior sanity-checked.
6. **Docs current** — quick tours, program guides, and instructions pages
   verified against the shipped feature set (documentation-currency rule).
7. **Launch checklist review** — owner walk-through of this list; anything
   unchecked either gets fixed or gets an explicit owner waiver noted here.

Exit criteria: **every item above checked or explicitly waived by the owner
in writing in this document. That is the definition of "finished product."**
